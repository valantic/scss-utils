/// Hides elements visually while keeping them accessible to screen readers.
///
/// This mixin uses techniques such as `clip-path`, `clip`, `overflow: hidden`, and `white-space: nowrap`
/// to hide elements from visual rendering without removing them from the accessibility tree.
///
/// **Browser Support:**
/// - The `clip-path` property is supported in modern browsers.
/// - The `clip` property is included for backward compatibility with older browsers.
///
/// @example
/// ```scss
/// .skip-link {
///   @include invisible;
/// }
/// ```
////
@mixin invisible {
  position: absolute;
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  white-space: nowrap;
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0); // Deprecated but retained for backward compatibility
  clip-path: inset(50%);
}
